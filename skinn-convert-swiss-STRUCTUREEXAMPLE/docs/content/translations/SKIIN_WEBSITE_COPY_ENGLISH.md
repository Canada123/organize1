## Product Section - 8 Benefits

### Title
Why SKIIN Leads in Cardiac Monitoring

### Subtitle
Eight ways SKIIN transforms heart health monitoring for better outcomes

### Benefits

#### 1. Extended Heart Screening for Deeper Insight
Replace short, 24–48-hour tests with extended monitoring (typically 10 days) to catch elusive arrhythmias. Continuous ECG recording provides a richer dataset, enabling cardiologists to detect intermittent events that would otherwise be missed.

#### 2. Shortened Wait Times & Earlier Detection
Rapid shipping and same-day setup mean you begin monitoring quickly. Early detection of arrhythmias and hypertension allows for timely intervention and reduces the risk of stroke or heart failure.

#### 3. Swift, Seamless Referrals
Our digital workflow connects you, your GP and specialists without complicated logistics. Referral forms and report sharing are integrated into the MVCP, enabling cardiologists to receive data promptly and act on critical findings.

#### 4. Comfortable Textile-Based SKIIN Band
A soft, adhesive-free band is shipped directly to your home. It feels like everyday clothing, is water-resistant and hypoallergenic, and can be removed briefly for showers or exercise. This improves compliance and user experience.

#### 5. AI-Powered Precision
Data are processed by advanced software trained on millions of ECGs. MediCalgorithmics' DeepRhythm Platform combines convolutional neural networks and transformer models to flag irregular events with high accuracy and generates clear, concise reports that include arrhythmia classification, heart-rate variability and event timelines.

#### 6. Fast Turnaround
Most results are returned within 24–48 hours after study completion. Cardiologists review AI-flagged events and provide personalised recommendations, ensuring you receive actionable insights quickly.

#### 7. Proven Technology
Thousands of studies have been completed using SKIIN's platform, trusted by leading clinics and dozens of respected cardiologists. The system delivers medical-grade accuracy while maintaining comfort and convenience.

#### 8. Health Canada Licensed
In addition to MDR Class IIa certification and Swissmedic registration, SKIIN technology is licensed by Health Canada, meeting rigorous North American medical standards.

### Closing Statement
Data flows securely from the SKIIN app to our ISO/IEC 27001-certified cloud, where AI and Swiss cardiologists work together to deliver clear, actionable reports.

## Problem Solution Section

### Title
The Silent Triad: Three Hidden Threats to Your Heart

### The Problem
- **Title**: The Problem
- **Description**: Many heart conditions hide quietly. Up to 70% of arrhythmias have no symptoms. A single 24-hour test offers only a brief snapshot, leaving you waiting and wondering. Traditional monitors are uncomfortable and disrupt daily life.

### The Solution
- **Title**: The Solution
- **Description**: SKIIN offers continuous heart-health monitoring from home. Our 10-Day Heart Screening catches irregular rhythms that 24-hour tests miss. The soft, wire-free garment feels like a second skin—water-resistant, washable and removable for showers. By combining ECG, blood pressure and sleep analysis, we monitor the Silent Triad (arrhythmia, hypertension and sleep apnoea) that often goes unnoticed.

### The Silent Triad

#### Arrhythmia Detection
Continuous ECG monitoring catches irregular heart rhythms that appear sporadically

#### Blood Pressure Monitoring
ABPM reveals masked hypertension and dangerous nocturnal patterns

#### Sleep Analysis
Identifies sleep apnoea which increases arrhythmia risk from 53% to 92%
